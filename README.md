# AIX: An Agnostic Intelligence Coalition Framework

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Experimental Notice**  
> Prototype created in Google AI Studio via declarative prompts. This project has **not undergone systematic testing or fine-tuning**; extensive refinement is required before any production use.

## üß± Core Concepts

### üèõÔ∏è Rooms & Coalition Logic

Rooms group Units by specialization and host a Manager Unit for lifecycle control. Coalitions form when Rooms cooperate, synchronized by the Communication Room.

#### Room Types

- **Admin Room**  
  - First entry point for user messages.  
  - Manager Unit forwards tasks to the Communication Room‚Äôs Manager.  
  - Includes a Unit for creating, editing, and deleting other Units.

- **Communication Room**  
  - Coordinates open/close loops and propagates directives across Rooms via its Manager Unit.  
  - Implements a stepping mechanism: the Admin Room‚Äôs manager can wake each coalition Unit in turn, collect its response, then return it to sleep.

- **Thought Room**  
  - Central reasoning hub; issues decisions that trigger actions in other Rooms.  
  - Hosts: Emotional Motor Units, a Self-Interest Unit with subordinate Ethics Unit, a Hypothesis Generator, and a Psychosocial Profile Unit (dreams, motivation, libido, personality traits, values, mood, user bio).

- **Information Room**  
  - Stores knowledge with paired RAG Units and RAG Bases.  
  - Hosts Digging Units to excavate deep insights from document neurons.  
  - Includes a System Profiler Unit to query and record host environment details.

- **Visual Room**  
  - Contains VLM and Stable Diffusion Units for stage-by-stage image interpretation and generation.

- **Voice Room**  
  - Performs layered analysis of incoming speech and layered audio synthesis.

- **Sanction Room**  
  - Enforces actions decided by the Thought Room.  
  - Contains:  
    - Desktop Control Unit (inspects GUI elements, background, object positions, current state, emojis)  
    - Sanction Units (apply and reapply penalties)  
    - Responder Unit (communicates results back to the user)  
    - Sanction Manager Unit

### üß† Units

Units serve as modular cognitive agents. They:

- Bind to local Ollama, Lmstudio, or cloud LLM providers with editable configurations.  
- Support **Prompt Templates** for custom instructions with dynamic variable injection.  
- Manage **Training Vectors** and **Experience Vectors** to evolve over time.  
- Choose between **Standard DB** or **Scalable DB** for memory storage.  
- Use **Todo Vectors** to handle long-running workflows without token-limit interruptions.  
- Add, remove, or reinforce document ‚Äúneurons‚Äù on demand, inspired by mind-map memory.  
- Convertible into **Motor Units** with internal control loops.  
- **Provider Support:** Every vector store or database attached to a Unit can select from a dropdown of supported providers (local or cloud).  
- **Core Protection:** Units essential for framework operation cannot be deleted.
